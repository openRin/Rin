## Introduction

Rin is a modern, serverless blog platform built entirely on Cloudflare's developer platform: Pages for hosting, Workers for serverless functions, D1 for SQLite database, and R2 for object storage. Deploy your personal blog with just a domain name pointed to Cloudflare—no server management required.

## Features
- **Authentication & Management**: GitHub OAuth login. The first registered user becomes an administrator, while subsequent users join as regular members.
- **Content Creation**: Write and edit articles with a rich, intuitive editor.
- **Real-time Autosave**: Local drafts are saved automatically in real-time, with isolation between different articles.
- **Privacy Control**: Mark articles as "Visible only to me" for private drafts or personal notes, synchronized across devices.
- **Image Management**: Drag-and-drop or paste images to upload directly to S3-compatible storage (e.g., Cloudflare R2), with automatic link generation.
- **Custom Slugs**: Assign friendly URLs like `https://yourblog.com/about` using custom article aliases.
- **Unlisted Posts**: Option to keep articles out of the public homepage listing.
- **Blogroll**: Add links to friends' blogs. The backend automatically checks link availability every 20 minutes.
- **Comment System**: Reply to comments or moderate them with delete functionality.
- **Webhook Notifications**: Receive real-time alerts for new comments via configurable webhooks.
- **Featured Images**: Automatically detect the first image in an article and use it as the cover image in listings.
- **Tag Parsing**: Input tags like `#Blog #Cloudflare` and have them automatically parsed and displayed.
